# Prajwal Koirala Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This site is a fully responsive, dark-mode portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and the Materialize CSS framework. It showcases my skills, experience, projects, and more—all organized into clickable, expandable sections for easy navigation.

## Features

- **Dark Mode:** Consistent dark theme across all pages using CSS variables.
- **Navigation Drawer:** A Material Design 3–inspired sidenav for desktop and mobile, allowing quick access to all sections.
- **Collapsible Sections:** Each major section (About, Skills, Experience, Certifications, Projects, Awards, Testimonials, Volunteer Work, Additional Information, Publications, Courses & Training, Blog, Interviews, Community Engagement, Training & Workshops, Hobbies & Interests, References, Future Goals, Social Media, and Contact) is clickable and expandable, with nested sub‑sections.
- **Lazy Loading:** Images use the `loading="lazy"` attribute to improve performance.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
- **Smooth Animations & Transitions:** CSS transitions enhance the user experience.
- **Accessibility:** ARIA labels, descriptive alt text, and proper semantic HTML improve accessibility for all users.
